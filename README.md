ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Meghana D., a bioinformatics graduate student at the University of Michigan.

I develop reproducible computational pipelines for clinical and omics data, focusing on:
- NLP & ML for EHR-based genetic and phenotypic data extraction
- Multi-omics integration (transcriptomics, proteomics, network analysis)
- Clinical risk modeling and real-world data-driven decision support

Some code is abridged due to institutional/publisher restrictions. For full code, detailed methods, or collaboration, please contact me.

**Interests:** clinical NLP, translational bioinformatics, EHR mining, omics, and reproducible workflow design.
